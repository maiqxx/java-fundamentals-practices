/**Martin makes delicious chocolates in various sizes.
 * Create a class for the business named Chocolates that contains
 * data field for weight, color and price. Create get methods for all
 * three fields. Create a set methods for color and weight, but not for the price.
 * Instead, when the weight is set, determine the price as P15 per gram.
 * Create a child class named DarkChocolate that contains an additional data field named
 * dark and methods to get and set in. in the child class, override the parentâ€™s
 * setWeight( ) method to set the price of a DarkChocolate object to P20 per gram.
 * Write an application that instantiates an object of each type and displays the details.
 * Save the files as Chocolates.java, DarkChocolate.java and DemoChocolates.java.
