/**Description:
 * 1.) A bank in your town updates its customersâ€™ accounts at the end of each month. The bank offers
 two types of accounts: savings and checking. Every customer must maintain a minimum balance.
 If a customer balance falls below the minimum balance, there is a service charge of 10.00 for
 savings account and 25.00 for checking account. If the balance at the end of the month is at
 least the minimum balance, the account receives interest as follows:
 a. Savings accounts receive 4% interest.
 b. Checking accounts with balances of up to 5000 more than the minimum balance receive 3%
 interest; otherwise, the interest is 5%.
